performous \- The free music and rhythm game

[description]
Performous is a free cross-platform karaoke, band and dancing game, where
one or more players perform a song and the game scores their performances
based on timing and accuracy.

Performous supports songs in UltraStar, Frets on Fire and StepMania formats.
Also, microphones and instruments from SingStar, Guitar Hero and Rock Band
as well as some dance pads are autodetected.

If you have trouble with the program (no songs found, audio not working, etc),
try running it on a terminal. Some useful debug information is printed there.

[audio device configuration]
Performous normally autodetects microphones and playback devices correctly, but if this fails on your machine, you will need to configure them in the Audio Devices screen. Advanced configuration is possible through the command line, just remember to enter the configuration menu and press \fBCtrl+S\fR to save them to your config file so that they don't need to be specified every time the program starts.

The list of available PortAudio devices is printed to the console, but it can also be seen from the GUI.
